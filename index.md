Complex numbers are numbers with a *real component* and an *imaginary component*, in the form a+bi, where a and b are **real numbers** and i is the ***imaginary unit***.

An extended explanation of complex numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

It can be helpful to visualiza complex numbers on the complex plane:

Complex can also be represented in polar form as seen below

To understand how the polar form is derived, check out this video:
